# BON TRAVAIL

The objective of this repository is to implement the "Bon travail" protocol, consisting of a server too which clients connect to to send "bon travail" notifications to the other members. 


## Installation


## Usage


## TODO:
- [ ] Find a server to handle the connection? 
    * The original option, ENS personal html server, will probably not work because we do not have enough access.
    * Another option would be better because we can play around with it more  
- [ ] Add error handling on the server side to avoid blocking the port every time there is a crash
- [ ] Check wrapping up, connexions are not properly closed with BYE
